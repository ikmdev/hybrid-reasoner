# Hybrid Reasoner

A hybrid reasoner based on ELK, but using structural subsumption for the SNOMED situation with explicit context hierarchy. 

A prototype implementation including temporal reasoning is in the hybrid-reasoner module.

The hybrid-reasoner-snomed module scales to SNOMED and is based on the IKM reasoner elk-snomed implementation.

Requires Java 23.

To build on Unix/Linux/OSX: `./mvnw clean install`

On Windows: `./mvnw.cmd clean install`

To run the integration tests:

```
./mvnw clean install -DskipITs=false
```

The integration tests require the SNOMED test data artifacts from the [reasoner-test-data project](https://github.com/ikmdev/reasoner-test-data)

Available at [Maven Central](http://central.sonatype.com/namespace/dev.ikm.hybrid-reasoner)
